Trump\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n \r\n\tDONALD J. TRUMP\r\n\tChairman and President , The Trump Organization\r\n\r\n\tDonald J. Trump is the very definition of the American success story , continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate , sports , and entertainment . He is the archetypal businessman –\xc2\x96 a deal maker without peer.\r\n\r\n\tMr . Trump started his business career in an office he shared with his father in Sheepshead Bay , Brooklyn , New York . He worked with his father for five years , where they were busy making deals together . Mr. Trump has been quoted as saying , \xc2\x93 '' My father was my mentor , and I learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of the construction industry from him.\xc2\x94 '' Likewise , Fred C. Trump often stated that \xc2\x93 '' some of my best deals were made by my son , Donald ... everything he touches seems to turn to gold.\xc2\x94 '' Mr. Trump then entered the very different world of Manhattan real estate.\r\n\r\n\tIn New York City and around the world , the Trump signature is synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses . Among them are the world-renowned Fifth Avenue skyscraper , Trump Tower , and the luxury residential buildings , Trump Parc , Trump Palace , Trump Plaza , 610 Park Avenue , The Trump World Tower ( the tallest building on the East Side of Manhattan ) , and Trump Park Avenue . Mr. Trump was also responsible for the designation and construction of the Jacob Javits Convention Center on land controlled by him , known as the West 34th Street Railroad Yards , and the total exterior restoration of the Grand Central Terminal as part of his conversion of the neighboring Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt Hotel . The development is considered one of the most successful restorations in the City and earned Mr. Trump an award from Manhattan\xc2\x92 's Community Board Five for the `` \xc2\x93tasteful and creative recycling of a distinguished hotel . `` \xc2\x94 Over the years , Mr. Trump has owned and sold many great buildings in New York including the Plaza Hotel ( which he renovated and brought back to its original grandeur , as heralded by the New York Times Magazine ) , the St. Moritz Hotel ( three times and now called the Ritz Carlton on Central Park South ) and until 2002 , the land under the Empire State Building ( which allowed the land and lease to be merged together for the first time in over 50 years ) .\r\n Click to Continue Reading\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAdditionally , the NikeTown store is owned by Mr. Trump , on East 57th Street and adjacent to Tiffany 's . In early 2008 , Gucci opened their largest store in the world in Trump Tower.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn 1997 , the Trump International Hotel & Tower opened its doors to the world . This 52 story mixed–use super luxury hotel and residential building is located on the crossroads of Manhattan 's West Side , on Central Park West at Columbus Circle . It was designed by the world-famous architect , Philip Johnson , and has achieved some of the highest sales prices and rentals in the United States . As one of only three hotels in the nation to have received a double Forbes Five-Star rating for both the hotel and its restaurant , Jean-Georges , it has also received the Five Star Diamond Award from the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences , and was voted the number one business hotel in New York City by Travel + Leisure Magazine . Conde Nast Traveler Magazine has named it the number one hotel in the US , and its innovative concept has been copied worldwide . It has won the Forbes Five-Star Hotel Award each year from 2009 to 2015 and ranked in the Conde Nast Traveler `` Readers ' Choice '' awards every year since 2010 . This year marks the eighteenth anniversary of this Trump Hotel Collection gem.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMr . Trump was also the developer of the largest parcel of land in New York City , the former West Side Rail Yards which is now Trump Place . On this 100 acre property , fronting along the Hudson River from 59th Street to 72nd Street , is the largest development ever approved by the New York City Planning Commission . There are a total of 16 buildings on the site , with Mr. Trump building the first nine buildings and the other portion of land being sold for a substantial amount . Mr. Trump also donated a 25 acre waterfront park on Trump Place and a 700 foot sculptured pier to the city of New York.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOther acquisitions in New York City include The Trump Building at 40 Wall Street , the landmark 1.3 million square foot , 72-story building located in Manhattan 's Financial District , directly across from the New York Stock Exchange and the tallest building in downtown Manhattan . This purchase , which took place at the depths of the New York City real estate market , is said to be one of the best real estate deals made in the last twenty-five years and is considered to have one of the most beautiful `` Tops '' of any building in the country . In addition , Mr. Trump built 610 Park Avenue ( at 64th Street ) , formerly known as the Mayfair Regent Hotel , which was very successfully converted into super-luxury condominium apartments achieving , at that time , the highest prices on Park Avenue . Further east , adjacent to the United Nations , sits the spectacular Trump World Tower , a 90-story luxury residential building and one of the tallest residential towers in the world . The Trump World Tower has received rave reviews from the architectural critics , with Herbert Muschamp of the New York Times calling it `` a handsome hunk of a glass tower . '' Likewise , Trump World Tower is considered one of the most successful condominium towers ever built in the United States.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn 2001 , Mr. Trump announced plans for his first foray into Chicago , where he planned to build the Trump International Hotel & Tower/Chicago . The 2.7 million square foot , 92-story mixed-use tower is located on the banks of the Chicago River , directly west of Michigan Avenue ( the most prominent site in Chicago ) , and is one of the tallest residences in the world and the ninth tallest building in the world . The architect is Skidmore , Owings & Merrill , Chicago , and the tower also includes four levels of retail shops . The hotel opened in January of 2008 to great acclaim , and in 2010 received Travel + Leisure Magazine 's award as the # 1 Hotel in the US and Canada as well as their `` World 's Best Business Hotel '' Award in 2014 . Conde Nast Traveler ranked the hotel in its `` Readers ' Choice Awards '' every year since 2011 . The hotel has earned Five-Star ratings for hotel and restaurant in the Forbes Travel Guide Awards in 2014 and 2015 , and has been a AAA Five Diamond Hotel award winner since 2011.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn 2002 , Mr. Trump purchased the fabled Delmonico Hotel , located at 59th Street and Park Avenue and re-developed it into a state-of-the-art luxury 35 story condominium named Trump Park Avenue . It was Mr. Trump 's desire to make this one of the most luxurious buildings in New York City , which was achieved . Mr. Trump has been lauded by a multitude of publications for having retained the grandeur and charm of the building while incorporating 21st century services and amenities . Mr. Trump is co-owner , with Vornado Realty Trust , of the iconic 555 California Street Tower ( The Bank of America building ) in San Francisco , one of the most important office buildings on the West Coast of the U.S. , and the prized 1290 Avenue of the Americas building , one of New York 's biggest buildings with the largest office floorplates in New York.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMr . Trump 's portfolio of holdings also includes Trump National Golf Club in Westchester , NY , a signature Fazio golf course and residential development , and a 250 acre estate known as the Mansion at Seven Springs , the former home of Katharine Graham ( of The Washington Post and Rockefeller University ) , which will be developed into a world class luxury housing development . Mr. Trump also purchased one of the largest parcels of land in California which fronts , for two and a half miles , along the Pacific Ocean . A Donald J. Trump championship golf course , called Trump National Golf Club/Los Angeles , has been built on this site , and it has been voted the number one golf course in California . Seventy-five luxury estates will follow . In addition , the Tom Fazio designed Trump National Golf Club has been built in Lamington Farms in Bedminster , New Jersey , on the 525 acre Cowperthwaite Estate , considered to be the best in the state . An additional 18 hole course was opened recently . In November of 2008 , Mr. Trump received approval to develop Trump International Golf Links Scotland , located in Aberdeen , Scotland , with over three miles of spectacular ocean waterfront . It opened on July 10 of 2012 and a second 18 hole course has been approved . In July 2013 , Golf Week Magazine named Trump International Golf Links Scotland `` The Best Modern Day Golf Course In The World . '' Trump International Golf Club in Rio Grande , Puerto Rico , has 1250 acres of ocean waterfront and has two 18 hole championship courses . In August of 2008 , Mr. Trump purchased a golf course in Colts Neck , New Jersey , which is now Trump National Golf Club/Colts Neck , and in February of 2009 he bought an 800 acre parcel of land and club near Washington , D.C. that fronts the Potomac River for three miles , to become Trump National Golf Club , Washington D.C. Two more golf courses were added to his portfolio in December of 2009 , Trump National Golf Club—Philadelphia , and Trump National Golf Club—Hudson Valley . In April of 2010 , a new celebrity reality series , `` Donald J. Trump 's Fabulous World of Golf '' debuted on Golf Channel with great success and the Feherty interview of Mr. Trump was the highest rated show in the history of Golf Channel.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn Palm Beach , Florida , Mr. Trump has converted the famous and historic estate owned by Marjorie Merriweather Post and E.F. Hutton , Mar-a-Lago , into the private , ultra-luxury Mar-a-Lago Club . It has received the award from the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences as the “Best Club Anywhere in the World.” It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1980 and Mar-a-Lago is often referred to as “The Jewel of Palm Beach.” Also in Palm Beach and located 7 minutes from Mar-a-Lago is the Trump International Golf Club . Designed by the famed golf course architect Jim Fazio , this $ 40 million golf course has magnificent tropical landscaping , water features and streams and elevations of 100 feet ( unprecedented in all of Florida ) . Opened in October 1999 , this course has been acclaimed as one of the best in the United States . An additional nine hole course was opened in 2006 to equal acclaim.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe Trump Hotel Collection was created to designate a new level of internationally important hotels , defined by elegance and attention to detail . One of the most elegant additions to the Las Vegas skyline is a super-luxury 60 story hotel condominium tower , the 5-star Trump International Hotel Las Vegas . This hotel was named by USA Today as the `` Best Bet in Vegas '' in 2012 and was listed on Travel + Leisure 's list of `` World 's Best Business Hotel Awards '' in 2011 . Current and future developments in the Trump Hotel Collection include towers in SoHo/New York ( which opened in spring of 2010 and made Travel + Leisure Magazine 's list of the best new hotels—the only one in New York to be included—as well as the AAA Five Diamond distinction in 2013 and 2014 ) , their `` World 's Best Business Hotel Awards : New York '' in 2011 ) , Chicago ( opened 2008 ) , Waikiki/Hawaii ( opened November 2009 which has received Forbes Travel Guide 's Five Star hotel rating in 2015 ) , Panama ( opened July 2011 and received the Luxury Travel Advisor 's `` Top 10 Luxury Hotel Openings in 2011 ) , Toronto ( which received the Forbes Five Star rating in 2014 ) , Trump National Doral Miami ( which will complete its $ 250 million transformation in early 2015 ) , and Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland ( a highly sought-after acquisition by The Trump Organization in 2014 ) . International hotels developments as of 2015 include Baku , Azerbaijan ( opening in June 2015 ) ; Vancouver , BC and Rio de Janiero , both opening in 2016 . Trump Towers , Istanbul , Sisli , combines two towers ( one residential tower and one office tower ) , located in the vibrant Mecidiyekov district.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn February of 2012 , The Trump Organization was selected as the developer of the famous Old Post Office Building in Washington , D.C . This building is considered a prized jewel and competition for it was fierce . Plans include a nearly 300 room luxury hotel , a museum gallery , and retaining the original exterior fa\xc3\xa7ade , doors , hallways and interior features . When completed , this hotel , which sits on Pennsylvania Avenue , will be one of the most luxurious in the world , and is seen as a generational asset by the Trump family . Trump International Hotel Washington , D.C. , is slated to open in 2016.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn a departure from his real estate acquisitions , Mr. Trump and the NBC Television Network are partners in the ownership and broadcast rights for the three largest beauty competitions in the world : the Miss Universe , Miss USA , and Miss Teen USA Pageants . A recent Miss Universe pageant won the night in ratings in the # 1 slot and it is currently broadcast in 180 countries . Miss USA won the night in ratings in 2011 . Trump Model Management , which was founded in 1999 , has become one of the leading modeling agencies in New York City.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMr . Trump rebuilt the Wollman Skating Rink ( now the Trump Rink ) in Central Park . This project was particularly special to Mr. Trump . The city had been trying for seven years to rebuild and restore the Rink , whereupon Mr. Trump interceded and restored the rink in four months at only $ 1.8 million of the City 's $ 20,000,000 cost . Similarly , he rebuilt Lasker Rink , in Harlem , also located in Central Park , which has had great success as well . In addition , Mr. Trump is given credit , as stated by everyone in the know and as Mark J. Penn 's book Microtrends reports , for having made a major and very favorable impact on the economy of the city by creating the condominium boom , versus the co-ops that were more prevalent in the past.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAn accomplished author , Mr. Trump 's 1987 autobiography , The Art of the Deal , became one of the most successful business best-sellers of all time , having sold in excess of three million copies , and being a New York Times number one best-seller for many weeks . The sequel , Surviving at the Top , was on The New York Times best-seller list and was also a number one best-seller as was his third book , The Art of the Comeback . Mr. Trump 's fourth book , The America We Deserve , was a departure from his past literary efforts . This book deals with issues most important to the American people today and focuses on the views regarding American political , economic and social problems . His fifth book , How To Get Rich : Big Deals from the Star of The Apprentice , became an immediate bestseller on all lists , as did Trump : The Way to the Top and Trump : Think Like a Billionaire which was released in October of 2004 . Trump : The Best Golf Advice I Ever Received was published in April 2005 , followed by Trump : The Best Real Estate Advice I Ever Received in 2006 . He has also teamed up with Robert Kiyosaki to make publishing history with their book , Why We Want You To Be Rich : Two Men , One Message , which in October of 2006 made the # 1 spot on the New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , and Amazon bestseller lists . Trump 101 : The Way To Success debuted in late 2006 . In October of 2007 Mr. Trump 's book with Bill Zanker , Think Big was launched .

Trump State Park.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tBy January of 2004 , Mr. Trump had joined forces with Mark Burnett Productions and NBC to produce and star in the television reality show , The Apprentice . This quickly became the number one show on television , making ratings history and receiving rave reviews . The first season finale had the highest ratings on television that year after the Super Bowl , with 41.5 million people watching .
