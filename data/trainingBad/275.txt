Some AAA games might be selling at a slightly slower rate than before , but those games are still making millions . Games are a huge business . I highly doubt that we will see a significant crash at the same scale that happened in the 80s . That one happened because there was a dozen of shitty systems to chose from and developers were putting out outright trash like ET and Superman . Even if AAA games are crap , they are at least pretty and playable to some degree . And then there is mobile market where people spend small amounts of money on microtransactions , which is not going away any time soon .

Blaming the potential ( console ) market crash and/or burn on the production of mobile games is silly , because the people making cheap mobile games aren\'t in the console market anyways and so don\'t get affected if it is successful or fails .

Sure , video games were a pretty successful medium back when the crash happened ( also recall that it was just the American game crash , other markets were alright ) , but the video game market now is fucking massive . It\ 's like saying movies or music are going to crash , when in reality they\ 've just shrunk . Video games are bigger than both of those now , the worst that can happen is a shrink , which I would argue is a good thing . If a giant publisher can\'t just churn out the same shit year after year , they\ 'll have to make something different . I think the markets are gon na go more and more towards niches soon .
