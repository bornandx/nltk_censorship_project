Resident Evil is a third-person survival horror game about a `` Biohazard '' featuring a large intersecting map , monsters and basic puzzles that involve backtracking.Herbs and Item boxes don\'t matter.They\ 're superficial , it doesn\'t matter that the powerup in Mario is a mushroom what matters is what it does and how it\ 's distributed.Boss fights and gun play feature in most games , including the worst parts of the series.Several games in recent memory have been trying to push this exact same argument.Doom discarded the design philosophy of the originals and thought `` well as long as we have demons and an awesome soundtrack this is all Doom really is '' .And Dead Rising 4 , `` well yeah we eliminated the timer and all the mechanics the series was built on , but we have Frank and zany weapons ! that\ 's all the franchise is ! `` When you consider superficial tribute satisfying fans instead of actually creating something in the spirit of the games , then there\ 's obviously a problem.Heck even Mighty No 9. had elements of Megaman , that doesn\'t detract from the fact they didn\'t follow through where it mattered .
