I do think censorship shouldn\'t happen , especially in instances that makes no sense to me . However , just personally , after reading more on the issue and their statement on it , it satisfied me enough to understand their decision . I guess just seeing the more angrier and volatile responses here kinda took me aback . I saw some people ask if they could possible patch it in as an option or offer it as a dlc to keep it intact , that sounds like a good compromise though I\ 'm unsure how doable that is on their end.I guess there\ 's just always going to be someone unhappy with what the end result is .

And not even strictly for JPN to US stuff or video games . Remember Batman Beyond : Return Of The Joker ? The original death was a flag gun Robin shot into the Joker\ 's chest , impaling and killing him ( albeit bloodlessly ) ; and the \'censored\ ' death shown on TV was him being pushed into water and being electrified to death , and you see an outline of his shadow as he screams bloody murder before collapsing . And there\ 's anime censorship too , although the example i\ 'd cite would probably stir some venomous reaction just for the series itself.The JPN version of the death here is more realistic and pretty dark all things considered , but the US version is fucking overkill and arguably even more messed up due to how unnecessary a violent kill it was all things considered .

Depiction of child murder has always been a sensitive subject in western media . Japan never gave a fuck . Go watch any 80\ 's anime and be amazed at how they get mowed down like cattle .

He literally doesn\'t actually know what 60fps looks like , he thinks Symphonia on GCN runs entirely at 30 and that the battles benefit the LEAST from high framerate .
