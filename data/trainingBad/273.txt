It\ 's fine , but not 4k or anything . My new job has been making me bank so I\ 'm in the mood to blow my wad.\n\nLG just came out w/ a 38 '' ultrawide @ 3840x1600 which looks sexy , but there\ 's also a game for the rift called `` I expect you to die '' that looks fun as fuck , and steam virtual desktop looks like a lot of fun to mess with . Also I have the room to do room scale.\n\nDo you all think VR is still too much in the early adopter\ 's phase to pick it up , or that Ultrawide monitors are a meme ( I like my LG , but more real estate would be nice ) . \n \n \n\n \n \n Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 14:26:43 No.360242056 Report Quoted By : Biggity wiggity bizzump Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 14:28:59 No.360242189 Report Quoted By : > > 360242276 > > 360241951Just get a VR set and 1 to 2 decent monitors ( remember there are things other than size , like response time , color saturation , contrast ratio , viewing angle , etc ) Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 14:30:22 No.360242276 Report Quoted By : > > 360242421 > > 360242683 > > 360242189Would you say Vive or Rift now that it has special controls ?

Wireless plus controllers and base station 2.0 are already on the way . Rift is dogshit.For now get an ultrawide , but 38 '' seems fucking massive and costly , are you sure it would be able to play games well ?

I\ 'm running 2X980 and was going to upgrade those in the next generation.So basically what you\ 're saying is wait for vive next year ? Hmm , well that would at least be an extra year for the tech to mature , what are the pros of the base station 2.0 ?

Is it even a monitor ? I\ 'm just thinking about input lag mainly , that does not seem like a gaming monitor in any way .

I would NOT get that if you\ 're planning on ever downsampling your games or even playing them in fullscreen mode . You\ 'll be playing in windowed mode for the rest of your life.I agree about the cost though , I want to buy one but the price is ridiculous .

I use it for PC gaming as well as my PS4 Pro hooked up to it . I like the 21:9 but half the games don\'t even support it on PC and none support it on PS4 . So what is a good 4k 60hz monitor to get ? 28 '' would probably be max for size since I don\'t have a ton of room . Want to keep it around $ 300 if possible .

SFM artists are also starting to make VR scenes.Just head over to the honey select threads on /h/ or /d/ and you can see the kind of crazy scenes people have set up . which you can stand up , fully walk around , kneel down , and view from every angle in with the vive . I really like how they made it so easy to share characters and even entire scenes by simply posting a jpeg all the data is inside.there\ 's also augmented reality mods ( think pokemon go ) i\ 've fapped to my waifu laying on my desk masturbating or hanging in the center of my room from the ceiling by chains and ropes being fucked by a train of guys .
