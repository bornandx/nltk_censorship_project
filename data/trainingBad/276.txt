Each cutscene has its own file , which contains its own models and references its own texture packs . It\ 's an absurd level of redundancy which massively bloats the file size of the game . I would recommend starting by modding a player model ( referred to as pl___.udas.lfs in the em folder ) . Assuming you want to mod ashley , her models for the part you play as her are pl_01 and pl_05 for sweater and pop-star , respectively.If you\ 're modding the Steam version , find the modding tools released by Son of Persia . Although they contained Persian propaganda , they\ 're the best you\ 'll be able to get .
