The Communists/leftists started to call anyone who thinks that the police force should jail rruglars of `` coxinha '' .They do that because leftists are ... well ... leftists . They think they are better than anyone and understand the world , but can\'t see they are being manipulated . It is a way to humiliate anyone from right wing.Mortadela is used to make fun of communists , because the PT and other leftists parties uses public money to `` buy '' poor people , so they will protest against anything that goes against leftist agenda . The letists parties used to give bread with ham away to these poor people.Petralha is someone who is leftist/communsit/agrees with PT agenda . PT means `` partido dos trabalhadores '' or `` worke\ 's party '' , they want to transform Brazil and Latin america in a communist block .

I live in Florianópolis , the capital of Santa Catarnia , and we\ 're getting buses that move with solar power , for example . Joinville , which is next to Florianópolis , is getting olympics tier fields for the schools.With that said , if she wants to go to Rio de Janeiro she will be in for a bad time . Most cities , even the Southern ones , have shitty neighborhoods that are run by drug dealers , and not even the police will dare get close to them because they are shot on sight ( they need armored vehicles to get around them ) . These places don\'t leak elsewhere though , so as long as you stay far away from them , you should be fine.No one is going to rob you or your girlfriend if you two are not wearing anything expensive or carrying the phone in the open , if that is your fear . Hide your valuable things as best as you can and you\ 'll never suffer with criminals.Rio is just shitty anyway , in so many ways , I have no words to describe how much of a shitty decision your GF is taking . Getting around it is awful as well , you\ 'll spend 2 hours stuck because of the traffic . It is way too hot , as in `` sweating intensely while standing still '' tier , half of the city is drug dealer territory and it is a leftist nest . Avoid it .

At that point you get a much smaller playerbase and are matched with tryhard veterans that will destroy you.When the Switch launches and the remastered ports of multiplayer stuff like Splatoon and Smash come in you\ 'll have another shot at hopping in early , if you care about multiplayer .
