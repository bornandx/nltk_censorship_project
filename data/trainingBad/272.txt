Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 01:57:44 No.360196752 Report Quoted By : - Battleborn is their biggest investment in a video game ever . More than BL1 and 2 combined.- he wanted to have a FPS where he\ 's a Jedi knight , fighting alongside Master Chief , and Gandalf . So by taking several ( crazy ) fantasy archtypes and and having them all represented , this concept allowed them to do that.- he\ 's glad about competition ( doesn\'t mention them , but clearly Overwatch , Paladins and such ) , as it motivates them and it also shows maybe they weren\'t crazy , and there\ 's a customer for this game- it has a big robust campaign , but they\ 're also doubling down on PvP- they have 300 or so people in their Texas HQ and probably 80 % of them work on Battleborn . Poplar is its codename.- more than 1 new IP in different phases of pre-production . And other products with their other franchises.- new Brothers in Arms is still in early pre-production . Not Furious 4 at all : - while doing it , they got really into gameloops , and stopped worrying about franchise tenets with BiA . They only worried about gameloops and going off into wild tangents . It stopped being BiA , they unhitched it from the franchise and pretty much became Battleborn . Montana was in F4 , is in BB.- `` The BiA game it deserves to be '' . Once they figure it out , they\ 'll announce it ( duh ) - Borderlands absolutely has a future ( duh ) , they\ 're still figuring it out ( re : question if it\ 's a shift or more of the same ) Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 02:09:54 No.360197765 Report Quoted By : > > 360197941 > > 360192378 > calling a project that repurposed itself into a wildly successful game a failureGotta be embarrassing when a `` failed '' project beats the living shit out of your own game .

This became apparent through leaks and press reports as the game came closer to being done . Not to mention that development stalled for almost five years after its announcement . All the while Sega made more and more trailers based on bullshots Randy was putting out . Which resulted in Sega getting sued when it turned out the game they got was nothing like the bullshots they were making. > The suit , filed in April 2013 by Roger Damion Perrine and John Locke on behalf of a class , claimed that Gearbox and Sega falsely advertised Aliens : Colonial Marines by showing demos at trade shows like PAX and E3 that were not ultimately accurate representations of the final product . Sega has suggested settling the lawsuit from their part and agreed to pay 1.25 million dollars . [ 37 ] The lawsuit lost class-action status and Gearbox was dropped from the case in 2015 . [ 38 ] Budget for this game was estimated to be at least forty million dollars .

It\ 'll be like Evolve all over again.They simply can\'t understand that their game was never meant to be , no one in the right mind wants it . This plane of reality REJECTS Battleborn , they\ 've lost , Overwatch won.For all their talk of it not being like Overwatch at all they\ 've inadvertently put the idea in the minds of the players that Battleborn is in the same league as Overwatch . That\ 's marketing 101 , don\'t acknowledge the competition . Their other mistake was releasing it so closely to Overwatch\ 's release . If they haven\'t done so already they need to take their marketing and publicity team out back and end them with a bullet to the head .

They still think it died because of Overwatch , in reality 2 million played the beta and said nope ! Hype of Overwatch died long ago , their game is still as dead as ever . People still aren\'t buying it for $ 5.See the problem they have is that Battleborn is like a hollywood movie , with the most ugly actors possible to employ . That all have awful voices and with horrible photography.There is no way to save this game without a full makeover , I\ 'm a person that didn\'t buy Overwatch because it has no campaign . I won\'t buy Battleborn because it\ 's disgusting to look at , I won\'t even buy it for $ 5 . I doubt I would even waste my time if it was f2p because why bother when you can download paladins .
