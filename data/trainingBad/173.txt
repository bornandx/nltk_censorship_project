Therefore I decided to start sharing some of the things I played with . Updating my old notes to an acceptable state takes time , so I will make more available when they are useful to some people.View Technical Notes\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \t\r\n My personal photographs.\r\n Sometimes when I travel , I take the time to take some pictures so that to share them with my family and friends . Since the pictures were already online and few friends linked to those pictures on their websites , I decided to open the access to everyone . I hope it will make you interested to visit those places.View Photographs\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Plenty of other things that I need time to make online.\r\n My Amiga 1200 demo , my old DOS and recent Windows PC demo effects , Coding stuff , my GBA demo effects , the musics I composed , some stuff about the Raine arcade game emulator I worked on , some things about Kung-fu , and plenty of little things such as Maxthon plugins , Photoshop plugins , etc .

It has become very popular and I am the first surprised and pleased . So far it has been downloaded over 2 million times ! \r\n Read More\r\n \r\n \r\n \t\r\n \r\n AllureMy new freeware tool to overcome a Windows limitation.Windows potential for customization has been very limited to Microsoft only Visual Themes and Visual Styles . I have been surprised not to find a free and easy way to enable every Windows user tapping into this potential to make their daily computer space look as pleasant as possible . So I decided to write this little freeware tool .

Recently someone implemented them on the GPU , since my graphics card can not run PS3.0 , I decided to make my own.\r\n Read More\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Screen SaversMy screen savers playground.Some old and one recent screen savers for PC only . Screen savers are quite a nice way to expose real time demo effects . Indeed each screen saver was suggested by friends or colleagues who liked the effect and wanted to have a screen saver doing it.\r\n Read More\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n Java AppletsMy real time java demo effects.Java is quite nice in many respects ; it allowed me to share some old and more recent real time demo effects I made with everyone . Applets can run on many machines , so it sorts of expanded the scope of my previous effects which were limited to Amiga and PC.\r\n Read More\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n \tHome | \r\n Software|\r\n Photographs|\r\n Technical Notes|\r\n Music|\r\n My Blog \r\n \r\n Copyright Â© 2011 .
