Its easy to use interface guarantees an easy work with Com-port.\n\t Look RS232 can send data through COM port , receive data from an outer device through COM port , it has port indication as well.\n\t Look RS232 supports connection at the standard speed of 110 115200 kbit/s , it supports commands of COM port program control.\n\t Look RS232 supports data input in ASCII , BIN , HEX , OCT formats , keeps log of the sent and received data and commands in ASCII , BIN , HEX , OCT formats , it has an option of time link ( relating to COM port activation ) .\n\t Look RS232 works with system initiated COM ports regardless of whether they are installed on motherboard or on supplementary in/output boards , e.g . VS-Com ( Roadrunner ) PCI-800H 8-port PCI.\n\t \n\t \n \n\t Click on screenshot to view descriptions \n of Look RS232 features.\n\t\t Features\n\t\t \n\t \n\t\tIn and out data streams logging\n\t\tTracing , breakpoints , step by step debugging \n\t\t Communication ports staus displaying\n\t\tUsing macros to automate frequently used operations\n\t\tFull history of sending and receiving commands and data\n\t\tTime stamp information for incoming and outgoing data and events\n\t\tLook RS is designed to give easy access to the PC serial ports.\n\t\t It have useful graphic user interface , no programming required.\n\t\tTransfers data from file\n\t\tSupport of any formats of data ( ASCII , BIN , HEX , OCT ) and different length of words\n\t\tFilters , different display modes\n\t\tFull duplex\n\t\t Supported baudrates range : 110..115200 kbit/s\n\t\t Can work with COM ports of the following types : \n\t\t -\tstandard on-board ports\n\t\t -\textension board ports\n\t\t -\tCOM ports connected to computer through USB port with COM port emulator\n\t\tCan save current session including all macros , data sent and received\n\t\tUseful option of data format selection .
