I\ 'm getting wrecked hard as I get used to the game , but it\ 's fun overall.\n\nI don\'t quite see the `` this game is difficult ZOMG '' stuff everyone talks about though , but rather , this to me feels more like the difficulty you\ 'd have in games back in the SNES and before . Which is really refreshing to see . It\ 's nice to finally have a game in a long time that punishes you for mistakes with death , and forces you to learn the level design and such through trial and error.\n\nI really do wish more games today would do this.\n\nI guess many people are taken aback by it simply cause they weren\'t around to play the SNES games back when this was more common.\n\nAnyway , one thing I got ta note , is it just me , or does the game have some serious Metroid/Castlevania vibes going for it ? In terms of level design and mechanics and such , it very much feels like what Castlevania should have been if it\ 'd had gone 3D properly.\n\nOh yeah , also , Bloodborne thread . \n \n \n\n \n \n Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 11:44:12 No.360233759 Report Quoted By : > > 360243629 > > 360250914 > > 360253723 > > 360233687Oh yeah , I wanted to say , for all the talk people have of games like Guacamelee and Shantae , and etc ... . being `` Metroidvanias '' yet very much missing the mark on what makes those games what they are , Bloodborne , to me at least feels much more like Super Metroid and Castlevania , than any of the other `` Metroidvanias '' do.Also , I should note I\ 've never played any of the other Souls games yet . BB is my first as that\ 's how it was recommended to me .

NeoNintendo fans are overly defensive of Nintendo and everything with their brand on it , and are insufferable . They jumped in at around the Wii era . Longtime Nintendo fans tend to be very critical of everything Nintendo does nowdays as we remember the days when they didn\'t fucking suck dick . Half of the shitposting in Nintendo threads these days ( especially XCX and Switch ) is from other Nintendo fans who are pissed . Not from console-warring faggots . You\ 'll often see people post timestamps with a WiiU and a copy of XCX when posting criticism , cause otherwise you get banned.Also , can we please talk about BB and Metroidvanias ? Hell , I\ 'd even be down to talk about Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid . There are at least a dozen other threads up right now were Nintendo fans can go defend the company name .

Not sure why since it\ 's not all that good.Dark Souls stood out with its combat because you didn\'t just spam that attack button . Enemies die in 1-2 hits but you have to think about how to get past their defenses while managing your stamina and commiting to your attacks etc . I don\'t want to oversell it as some deep game , but it\ 's more thoughtful and methodical than the vast majority of games and it leaves lots of freedom for playstyle and build variety.Bloodborne went in a different direction from there where you have more mobility and less stamina consumption , but it changed the way you played the game in an interesting way . It added quicksteps , trick weapons , and Rally . It changed the way critical attacks work and added guns and hunter tools.Dark Souls 3 doesn\'t do either of those things , it\ 's just spammy DaS with no atmosphere . And it\ 's linear as hell , it doesn\'t even try to do that metroidvania thing that OP talks about . Dark Souls 3 is a boring slog .

Yes , even a step down from Dark Souls 2 , because I got more play time out of that title . This game is functional , it serves its purpose and it\ 's not outright horrible , I can see how some people would enjoy it . But the fans make me hate the fuck out of this game . They act like it\ 's an undisputed masterpiece and you CAN NOT ever criticize it without getting console war responses even if you own a Ps4 and have played the game . As for me , I got bored with it before ever finishing my second playthough . Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 18:37:54 No.360259230 Report Quoted By : > > 360259659 > > 360258892Is that so ?
