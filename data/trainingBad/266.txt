Usually starts with the inventory getting a little transparent , and then some minutes later it is totally invisible , both when I press TAB and when I try to open a storage . Restarting the game fixes it but it\ 's recently been happening way too often , so it\ 's too annoying .

You either found a bug or a Stalker , which is a small creature that can be very easily avoided . And I mean very easily , it only attacks in a straight line , it\ 's completely incapable of turning.http : //subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Stalker Anonymous Anonymous Sat 10 Dec 2016 14:43:40 No.360242987 Report Quoted By : > > 360243172 > > 360242620I know about the Sand Sharks and Stalkers . I was trying to investigate the mothership after getting the rad suit , but as I reached the end of one of them after seeing a few sandsharks and thinking no problem , I was greeted by the leviathan roar and shortly afterwards I took 90 % of my life in 1 hit , which I quickly healed up , swam the fuck away and it somehow left me alone . Ever since I\ 've been too spooked to venture far from the shallows and the green forest and just basebuild in the shallows with almost no blueprints of interest .

Around the Aurora , in the dunes , and in the mountains . The dunes and the mountains are very large biomes without any `` obstacles '' such as trees or mountains , so you\ 'll know when you get there . They are also very late-game . No Reapers anywhere else.Avoiding the Reaper from the Aurora is also possible if you first swim to the Aurora\ 's back , then circle it to the front . Just be careful once you get to the front and quickly swim the fuck to the entrance , which is above the surface , thus making the Reaper unable to touch you . But I don\'t think it will even notice you if you do what I said .

Guess I just got ta progress in the other direction . I was about 1 scanning piece away to getting the small submarine , but my game had a fatal bug so I had to start over . My welding tool didn\'t work , so I couldn\'t repair any doors and therefore couldn\'t get into a lot of the wreckages around the areas where all the juicy stuff is.I couldn\'t find any fix for it , so I just remade my game .

Or are you forced to explore further away at some point because you ran out of materials ?
